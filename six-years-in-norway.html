<p>I arrived in Norway on the 20th of April 2012 with the aim of staying for at least 5 years. I figured you need at least 5 years to make such a huge move worthwhile - it would be enough time to learn the language, get a proper job, make friends and feel at home in the culture. I left South Africa with cash in hand, moved in with my girlfriend, and started looking for a job in Norway. Alongside this I was doing two consulting jobs as an economist: one for an NGO in Norway and another for the Department of Energy in South Africa. The short story is that I got a job quite quickly as a data analyst at a Norwegian telecommunications company, Telenor. I worked there for 3 years after which I took a job as a software engineer at the University of Oslo's Center for IT. There I am group leader for Research Services working mostly with sensitive data. I'm almost fluent in Norwegian, we own a flat, have a cat, and a son. I guess you could say I'm an <em>integrated</em> immigrant. Anyways, I thought it was time to reflect more systematically about certain aspects of the journey.</p>
<h2 id="meta">Meta</h2>
<p>I have actually been trying to write this post for more than a year. It started off with the title, &quot;Five years in Norway&quot;. I gave up on it because even though I could say many things about the last six years, I find it difficult not to generate clich√©s. So at the risk of doing so, I'm going to try to commit something to writing and be done with it.</p>
<h2 id="norwegian">Norwegian</h2>
<p>Learning a new language is an adventure - especially learning to live in that language. I had a number of advantages that set me up for a good learning path. 1) Having two Germanic languages, Afrikaans and English, as background for Norwegian is a good start. One can recognise many words to begin with. 2) My girlfriend is Norwegian, so I can ask for help at home. 3) I found a job where I was not required to speak Norwegian, so I had plenty of time to learn, and 4) I made Norwegian friends who helped me by refusing to speak English to me, even though I would speak English to them.</p>
<p>To speed up learning I met with people before work, practicing having conversations, reading out loud to learn pronounciation and increase my vocabulary, and later on did some informal writing exercises. After that I took a week-long intensive course at a community college, and wrote a test to certify my competence. In passing the test I have evidence that my Norwegian is good enough to enroll for University, and it allowed me to obtain permanent residence. At my current job I speak Norwegian about 30% of the time.</p>
<p>Of course one is never finished learning a language: there are always new challenges popping up, new situations in which you suddenly find you lack the vocabulary to express yourself. And the extent to which you can immerse yourself in a language, and its cultural artefacts, is endless. So the journey is far from over.</p>
<h2 id="identity">Identity</h2>
<p>I often joke at home that I am a traitor to my home country, to my mother tongue, and to my culture. While I don't really think this is true, there is a certain amount of tension in me, about my relationship to South Africa, Afrikaans, and my original culture.</p>
<p>When I say that I am losing my identity, also half joking, some people tell me that rather than losing one I am gaining another. But I'm not so sure. When you don't live in a country, you are not surrounded by the people, you do not speak the language, you do not experience the collective events. In short, you fall out of the psyche of the country and the culture. I do not live in a diaspora community either, so there is no community of South Africans around me keeping the everyday reality of the country and the culture alive. While I am not completely disconnected (I visit for more than a month every year, I read news, I speak to friends and family) I can feel myself losing touch with the reality of the country. And when I am there I notice that I sometimes struggle to complete my sentences in Afrikaans.</p>
<p>None of this makes me a <em>traitor</em>, but I think there is some truth to the statement that I am losing a part of my identity. And it is also true that I am gaining new parts, this is only natural. But what frustrates me sometimes is that it is quite a lonely identity: 2/3 South African, 1/3 Norwegian?</p>
<p>I think all immigrants face this challenge: the more you integrate the more you sacrifice from your old identity. After a while it can sometimes feel like you are stuck in the middle: not quite Norwegian, not quite South African either. This is not science though, these are just feelings I have from time to time, and it is not obvious to me what to do with them.</p>
